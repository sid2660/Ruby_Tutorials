#	     => Class is a specification or a blue print (set of instructions) of how
#	        to provide some service.
#	     => Like Blueprint, Class has some exact specifications.
#	     => Many Objects can be created from the same class.
#	     => Classes can conatin methods, variables for an object.\
#	     => A class can have subcalss that can inherit all or some of the 	
#	        characteristics of the class.
#	     => Subclasses can also define their own methods and variables that are 
#	        not part of their superclasses.
